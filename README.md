This is a HTML/CSS/React project that I modified from a React note taking project. The design for the license was modified from a Codepen project (see below for citation). I broke down the project into separate modules and imported them into each other as needed. I used the 'useState' hook in order to create license plates and update the input field. The names are also saved locally using the 'useEffect' hook. Plates can also be deleted using a filter method.

The license plate CSS is derived from Alex Litel:
